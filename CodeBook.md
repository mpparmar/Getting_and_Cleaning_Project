Download file
1.	You have to download source data from link below and unzip it to working directory of R Studio.
2.	You have to perform R script.
About source data
As source data for work was used Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
About R script
File with R code "run_analysis.R" perform 5 following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work):
1.	Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Reading files
Reading trainings tables
Reading testing tables
Reading feature vector
Reading activity labels
Assigning column names
Merging all data in one set
2.	Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Reading column names
Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation
Making nessesary subset from setAllInOne
3.	Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
5.	Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
Making second tidy data set
Writing second tidy data set in txt file
PS..The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.
About variables:
•	x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
•	x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
•	features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
